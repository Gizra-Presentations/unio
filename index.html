          * Here it goes again you probably tell youself
          * You are in a room, a stranger in front of you, and for the next 20 minutes,
          me - the stranger, is going to give you in much to detail the entire history of a company
          you never heard about, lots of lots of advantages of our product, and how paying our $25 a month
          will change your life.
          * And then, when it's over, and you'll say "we'll think about it", we'll part ways
          and you'll get every few months a follow up email.
          * You have been down that road, and so have we. It's not intereseting, and it's not who we are.
          * Instead, when I'm thinking about the right way to, quickly and accuretly, present who we are
          I prefer to imagine we are not in this meeting room.
          * I'd like to think we are in a social gathering. You know, it's a party, there are a few drinks. We know the host,
          and a bunch of people - and then we come across you folks.
          * Hi, there what's up. Cheers. We start a small conversation.
          What's your name? Amitai
          What are you doing here? I'm friends with the host
          Do you have a family? Yeah, a wife and three kids.
          What are you doing a living? Here the social gathering etiquete kicks in. I cannot start going on and on about my job,
          and like in a conventioanl meeting, go into too much detail.
          * So I say something like, I work in the distributed company, meaning we're all over the world, called Unio.

          * We're doing Edtech - education technology - stuff.
          * Interesting, you might say, What kind of stuff. And here I always pause a bit. You know, how do you distille your day to day job
          to a single sentnce, but it's possible, so I say something like "In a bit simplistic way, we basically have an online web application that allows
          teachers to prepare kind of powerpoint lessons, and then in the computer class room broadcast those lessons to the kids devices, and interact with them in real time."
          * At this point, I always, but always get the same exact two questions, in the same exact order.
          * The first is "Aren't there like gazillion more products like that?"
          * Not gazilion I say, way less - but yeah there are a few. But there are also hunderds of brands of cerals. Most of rubish, some are good.
          I'd like to think we're recognized with the good ones. We're pretty awesome. I mean, we are awesome.
          * And then comes to second question. I love it. Because when I hear it, I know the conversation isn't dying. After all we are in a
          socail gathering, no one wants to be the boring one.
          * "How do you convince teachers to use computers?", and the simple answer Is -- I don't.

          <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125707/40117710-6269f29c-5920-11e8-8e19-d9cf326af7e1.jpeg" alt="">

            * Folks, when we imagine a class room, and it hardly matters if you are old or younger than me, a boy or a girl,
            from Europe or not, we probably imagine almost the same. There is a class, a whiteboard, and a teacher in front of kids.
            Maybe there's a projector or maybe there is not. Maybe there are tables in rows, or maybe in circles. But in the end it's almost and iconic classroom.
            But a matter of a fact is that many schoolds for many years already have classrooms with computers or tablets. I'm not talking about the future,
            I'm talking about the present. You probably know it, either you have been in one, or maybe you have kids or family members that are using those classes.
            And this is where we go in, and we have a different kind of message, a very down to earth one. We're not looking at revolutinizing the education.
            We are not saying we'll make the teachers life paradise. We're just saying - you have already embrassed the future, or the present, you have embrassed reality
            by having those computer class rooms. Lets just get the most of out it.
            * Those computers that are already in classrooms you can imagine how it looks. Either the kids are zoomibes, each one in front of their own device, or
            the teacher is just giving frontal class, same as a normal class, only with computers. Unio is trying (and succeeding) and brining a hybrid approach.
            * Listen, very broadly speaking people want three things, food shelter, the basic stuff. And pardon the simplifications: More money, Better use of their time,
            and appreciation.
            * Don't argue with those items, I'm trying to make a point.
            * So if we talk about teachers, making more money - we can't help there. Better use of the time (before the class, while in the class, after class).
            Appreciation, to present what you have done. To your collegues, friends, family, boss. Also for the students.
            * Those two point actually applies also to the students.

            * While I've said it's like power point, it actually isn't too power pointy, in the sense of how many tools and features tha you have.
            * Folks, we're coming from the education field. We know that teachers don't want to learn how to operate a complex software, not everybody is a power user
            and not everybody is an early adaptor. And in all honestly a lot of teachers are not very tech savy. So we try to find a balance between complexity and between
            being able to prepare an appealing lesson. And I'm empshazing appealing. A beautiful background picture, and laydown the subject, with the right font, the right size,
            the right color. All that is done with Unio's tools.

            * There are obviously more features, but here are the important points. Schools have computers. Your school has computers.
            The question is, are you getting the most out of it. Are teachers getting the most out of it, and are students getting the most out of it?
            Are students sitting like zoombies, is it an anti-social activity. Or is it on the other hand a regular lesson, which happens to be in a class filled with computers.
            * Can your teachers have a better use of their time, Can your teachers have better ways to be proud of the hard work they are doing? Can students?
            * This is what Unio brings to the table.
            * In this screen, you can see our new designs. We're constantly improving, we're constantly getting feedback back from the field - from the classroom, and we're constantly improving.
            * And we want to have you folks take part of this joureny with us.
