          * Here it goes again you probably tell youself
          * You are in a room, a stranger in front of you, and for the next 20 minutes,
          me - the stranger, is going to give you in much to detail the entire history of a company
          you never heard about, lots of lots of advantages of our product, and how paying our $25 a month
          will change your life.
          * And then, when it's over, and you'll say "we'll think about it", we'll part ways
          and you'll get every few months a follow up email.
          * You have been down that road, and so have we. It's not intereseting, and it's not who we are.
          * Instead, when I'm thinking about the right way to, quickly and accuretly, present who we are
          I prefer to imagine we are not in this meeting room.
          * I'd like to think we are in a social gathering. You know, it's a party, there are a few drinks. We know the host,
          and a bunch of people - and then we come across you folks.
          * Hi, there what's up. Cheers. We start a small conversation.
          What's your name? Amitai
          What are you doing here? I'm friends with the host
          Do you have a family? Yeah, a wife and three kids.
          What are you doing a living? Here the social gathering etiquete kicks in. You can start going on and on about your job,
          and like in a meeting, going into much detail.

        <h1 style="font-style: italic;">Unio</h1>

        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
          * So, I work in the distributed company, meaning we're all over the world, called Unio. We're doing Edtech - education technology - stuff.
          * Interesting, you might say, What kind of stuff. And here you know I always pause a bit. You know, how do you distille your day to day job
          to a single sentnce, but it's possible, so I say something like "In a bit simplistic way, but we basically  have a an online web application that allows
          teachers to prepare kind of powerpoint classes, and then broadcast it them the kids devices, and interact with them in real time."
          * At this point, I always, but always get the same exact two questions, in the same exact order.
          * The first is "Are there like gazillion more stuff like that?"
          * Not gazilion I say, way less - but yeah there are a few. But there are also hunderds brands of ceral. Most of rubish, some are good.
          I'd like to think we're recognized with the good ones. We're pretty awesome. I mean, we are.
          * And then comes to second question. I love it. Because when I hear it, I know the conversation isn't dying. After all we are in a
          socail gathering, no one wants to be the boring one.
